Absolutely, Maryam — here’s a clean, conflict-free guide to setting up Git in VS Code from scratch, tailored to your workflow and repo hygiene goals.

🧭 Step-by-Step Guide: Git Setup in VS Code (No Conflicts)
✅ 1. Create Your Project Folder
Choose a location outside OneDrive to avoid sync conflicts:
C:\Users\HP\Documents\Frontend-Portfolio


Open this folder in VS Code:
- File → Open Folder → Select your project folder

✅ 2. Initialize Git
Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ) and run:
git init


This creates a .git folder and starts tracking your project.

✅ 3. Create Your Files
Now create your project files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js (optional)
- README.md ← Create this now, before connecting to GitHub
📌 Tip: Add a meaningful header to README.md:
# Frontend Developer Portfolio
A showcase of responsive layouts and modular HTML/CSS components.



✅ 4. Create a Clean .gitignore
Add this file to exclude clutter:
# Python cache and virtual environments (if used)
__pycache__/
*.pyc
venv/

# Node modules (if using npm)
node_modules/

# VS Code settings
.vscode/

# OS and temp files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db



✅ 5. Stage and Commit Locally
Run:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with README and project structure"



✅ 6. Create a GitHub Repo (Without README)
Go to GitHub and:
- Click New Repository
- Name it Frontend-Developer-Portfolio
- Uncheck “Add README file” ← this avoids merge conflicts
- Click Create Repository

✅ 7. Connect Local to GitHub
Back in VS Code terminal:
git remote add origin https://github.com/BigJasmine/Frontend-Developer-Portfolio.git


Then push:
git push -u origin main



🧠 Why This Prevents Conflicts
- You created README.md locally before pushing
- You didn’t let GitHub auto-generate one
- Your .gitignore excludes clutter from the start
- You’re working outside OneDrive, avoiding file lock issues

Let me know if you want help writing a standout README.md that showcases your frontend skills, or setting up your first HTML/CSS commit. You’re building this portfolio with precision and clarity.
