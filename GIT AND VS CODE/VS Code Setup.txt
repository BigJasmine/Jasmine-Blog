Git/VS Code Setup

---

### ðŸ§  What Went Wrong
1. **Git doesnâ€™t know who you are** â€” you havenâ€™t set your name and email yet
2. **You tried to push a branch (`main`) that doesnâ€™t exist yet**
3. **You already added the remote origin, so re-adding it caused an error**

---

### âœ… Fix It in 3 Steps

#### **Step 1: Set Your Identity**
Run these commands in your terminal (replace with your actual name and email):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Maryam Agbalaya"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

This sets your identity for all future commits.

---

#### **Step 2: Create Your First Commit Properly**
If you havenâ€™t added any files yet, do this:

```bash
echo "# Jasmine-Blog" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
```

If you already did that, skip to step 3.

---

#### **Step 3: Push to GitHub**
Now push your code:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you get an error saying the remote already exists, thatâ€™s fine â€” it just means you added it earlier.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus Tip
To check your current branch name, run:

```bash
git branch
```

If it says something like `* master`, you need to rename it to `main` before pushing:

```bash
git branch -M main
```

Let me know if you want to add a `.gitignore`, write a README, or make your repo look professional on GitHub. You're doing great!
