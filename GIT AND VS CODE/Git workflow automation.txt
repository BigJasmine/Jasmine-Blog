automate Git workflow using VS Code’s GUI buttons**, so you don’t need to type commands every time:

---

## 🧠 Prerequisite: Git Must Be Initialized
If you’ve already run `git init` and connected to GitHub, you’re good to go. Otherwise, I can help you set that up.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Use VS Code’s GUI to Push Changes

### 🔃 1. Open the Source Control Panel
- Click the **Source Control icon** (🔃) on the left sidebar
- You’ll see a list of changed files

---

### 📝 2. Stage and Commit Your Changes
- Type a **commit message** at the top (e.g. “Add new layout to blog.html”)
- Click the **✓ Commit** button below the message box

---

### 🚀 3. Push to GitHub
- Click the **… menu** (three dots) in the Source Control panel
- Choose **Push**
- VS Code will push your committed changes to GitHub

If it’s your first push, it may ask you to sign in or confirm the remote. Once done, it remembers your settings.

---

### 🔄 4. Pull Changes (If You Edited on GitHub)
- Click the **… menu** again
- Choose **Pull** to sync changes from GitHub to VS Code

---

### 🧩 Optional: Add Files Without Terminal
- Right-click in the Explorer sidebar → **New File** or **New Folder**
- Save your changes
- Go to Source Control → Commit → Push
